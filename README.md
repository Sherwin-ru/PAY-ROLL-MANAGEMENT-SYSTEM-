The Payroll Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and
automate the payroll processing tasks within an organization. It is developed using PHP for
server-side scripting, MySQL for database management, and Bootstrap for creating a
responsive user interface. The system provides secure login and registration features with
password hashing and session management to ensure only authorized access. It allows
administrators to perform CRUD operations on employee and payroll records efficiently. A
dashboard displays key metrics such as the total number of employees and the total amount of
payroll disbursed using SQL aggregate functions. The use of PDO (PHP Data Objects)
enhances database security by preventing SQL injection attacks. This system reduces the
dependency on manual payroll methods, increases accuracy, and saves time in salary
disbursement processes. The application is designed to be scalable, allowing for future
enhancements like leave tracking, payslip generation, email notifications, and role-based
access controls. The main objective of this project is to eliminate manual payroll processing,
reduce errors, and save time by providing a centralized platform for payroll operations. With
features such as password hashing, employee and payroll CRUD operations, and dashboard
summaries, the system demonstrates an efficient solution for small to medium-sized
businesses.
